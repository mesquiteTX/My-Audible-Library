window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Payback is personal for a former NYPD detective taking on a corrupt cop and a dirty accounting firm in this adrenaline-laced thriller from the number one </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling author of </b><b><i>Sleepers</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Tin Badges</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>“Carcaterra’s keen eye and deft style bring New York City to stunning life. A brilliant thriller by one of the all-time greats.” (Jeffery Deaver, number one internationally best-selling author)</p> <p>If there’s one kind of person Tank Rizzo hates most in this world, it’s a dirty cop. Criminals are at least honest about being dishonest; dirty cops are a disgrace to the badge they carry. Detective Eddie Kenwood is one such disgrace. He’s got the highest signed-confession rate in the NYPD and a distinguished career built on putting men behind bars - whether they’re guilty or not doesn’t matter much to him. When Tank’s partner, Pearl, tells him about an old family friend Kenwood put in jail for a murder he didn’t commit, Tank and Pearl vow to take Kenwood down.</p> <p>Also in need of a takedown: the money-laundering accounting firm where Tank’s brother used to work - before he mysteriously died, leaving Tank the sole guardian of his nephew, Chris. Chris smells a rat and enlists Tank’s help to bring the men who had his father killed to justice.</p> <p>Working two big cases means getting out the big guns, and Tank assembles his A-team. With help from a retired mobster, a professional boxer, a Chelsea psychic, a dog named Gus, and the US attorney - not to mention his and Pearl’s own quick wits and Chris’ burgeoning skills as a computer whiz - Tank gears up to take on his most dangerous and personal cases to date.</p>";
