window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>Naked Prey,</i> John Sandford puts Lucas Davenport through some changes. His old boss, Rose Marie Roux, has moved up to the state level and taken Lucas with her, creating a special troubleshooter job for him for the cases that are too complicated or politically touchy for others to handle. In addition, Lucas is now married and a new father, both of which are fine with him: He doesn't mind being a family man. But he is a little worried. For every bit of peace you get, you have to pay - and he's waiting for the bill. </p> <p>It comes in the form of two people found hanging from a tree in the woods of northern Minnesota. What makes it particularly sensitive is that the bodies are of a black man and a white woman, and they're naked. \"Lynching\" is the word that everybody's trying not to say - but, as Lucas begins to discover, in fact the murders are not what they appear to be, and they are not the end of the story. There is worse to come - much, much worse. </p> <p>Filled with the rich characterization and exceptional drama that are his hallmarks, this is Sandford's most suspenseful novel yet.</p>";
