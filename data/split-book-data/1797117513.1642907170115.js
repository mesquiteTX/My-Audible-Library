window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“[E]ngaging, inventive…brimming with mystery and intrigue” (</b><b><i>Crime by the Book</i></b><b>)</b></p> <p><b>In this “engrossing piece of Nordic noir” (</b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><b>, starred review) and sequel to the number-one international best seller </b><b><i>The Tenant</i></b><b>, detectives Jeppe Kørner and Anette Werner race to solve a series of sordid murders linked to some of the most vulnerable patients in a Danish hospital.</b></p> <p>Hospitals are supposed to be places of healing. But in the coronary care unit at one of Copenhagen’s leading medical centers, a nurse fills a syringe with an overdose of heart medication and stealthily enters the room of an older male patient.</p> <p>Six days earlier, a paperboy on his route in central Copenhagen stumbles upon a macabre find: the naked body of a dead woman, lying in a fountain with arms marked with small incisions. Cause of death? Exsanguination - the draining of all the blood in her body.</p> <p>Clearly, this is no ordinary murder. Copenhagen investigator Jeppe Kørner, recovering from a painful divorce and in the throes of a new relationship, takes on the case. His partner, Anette Werner, now on maternity leave after an unexpected pregnancy, is restless at home with a demanding newborn and an equally demanding husband. While Jeppe pounds the streets looking for answers, Anette decides to do a little freelance sleuthing. But operating on her own exposes her to dangers she can’t even begin to fathom.</p> <p>As the investigation ventures into dark corners, it uncovers the ambition and greed that festers beneath the surface of caregiving institutions - all the more shocking for their depravity - and what Jeppe and Anette discover will turn their blood as cold as ice....</p>";
