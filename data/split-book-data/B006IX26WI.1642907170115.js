window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The inspiration for the major motion picture <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i>, starring Gary Oldman and Colin Firth. </p> <p>The first novel in John le Carré's celebrated Karla trilogy, <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i> is a heart-stopping tale of international intrigue. </p> <p>The man he knew as \"Control\" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus. But George Smiley isn't quite ready for retirement - especially when a pretty, would-be defector surfaces with a shocking accusation: a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest level of British Intelligence. Relying only on his wits and a small, loyal cadre, Smiley recognizes the hand of Karla - his Moscow Centre nemesis - and sets a trap to catch the traitor. </p> <p>The feature film adaptation of <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i> is directed by Tomas Alfredson (<i>Let the Right One In</i>) and features a cast that includes Gary Oldman as Smiley, Academy Award-winner Colin Firth (<i>The King's Speech</i>), and Tom Hardy (<i>Inception</i>).</p>";
