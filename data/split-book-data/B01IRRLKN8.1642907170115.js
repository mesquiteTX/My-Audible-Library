window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Over the years Dirk Pitt has always had a knack for finding trouble. This time it has found him.</i> </p> <p>The extraordinary new novel from the grand master of adventure and number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. </p> <p>Pitt, the director of the National Underwater and Marine Agency, is on the Black Sea, helping to locate a lost Ottoman shipwreck, when he responds to an urgent Mayday - \"under attack!\" - from a nearby freighter. But when he and his colleague, Al Giordino, arrive, there is nobody there. Just dead bodies, a smell of sulfur in the air, and, as Pitt and Giordino explore, a blast from the stern that scuttles the ship swiftly, almost taking them with it. </p> <p>The more the two of them search for the secret of the death ship, the deeper they descend into an extraordinary series of discoveries. A desperate attempt in 1917 to preserve the wealth and power of the Romanov Empire. A Cold War bomber lost with a deadly cargo. A brilliant developer of advanced drone technology on an unknown mission. Modern-day nuclear smugglers, determined Ukrainian rebels, a beautiful antiterrorism agent from Europol - all will combine to present Pitt with the most dangerous challenge of his career. </p> <p>And not only Pitt. His two children, marine engineer Dirk and oceanographer Summer, are exploring a mysterious shipwreck of their own when they are catapulted into his orbit. The three of them are used to perilous situations - but this time they may have found their match. </p> <p>Filled with breathtaking suspense and remarkable imagination, <i>Odessa Sea</i> is further proof that when it comes to adventure writing, nobody beats Clive Cussler. </p>";
