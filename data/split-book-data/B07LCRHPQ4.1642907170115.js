window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A new investigation threatens to unearth skeletons from Rebus' past in this \"must-read\" (Tana French) mystery.</b></p> <p>Rebus' retirement is disrupted once again when skeletal remains are identified as a private investigator who went missing more than a decade earlier. The remains, found in a rusted car in the East Lothian woods, not far from Edinburgh, quickly turn into a cold-case murder investigation. Rebus' old friend Siobhan Clarke is assigned to the case, but neither of them could have predicted what buried secrets the investigation will uncover.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rebus remembers the original case - a shady land deal - all too well. After the investigation stalled, the family of the missing man complained that there was a police cover-up. As Clarke and her team investigate the cold-case murder, she soon learns a different side of her mentor, a side he would prefer to keep in the past.&nbsp;</p> <p>A gripping story of corruption and consequences, this new novel demonstrates that Rankin and Rebus are still at the top of their game.</p>";
