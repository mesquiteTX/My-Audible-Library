window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Dirk Pitt is oceanography’s answer to Indiana Jones”, praises the Associated Press. “Exotic locations, ruthless villains and many narrow escapes - Cussler’s fans come for swashbuckling [and] he delivers”. And now Pitt’s back to find a crucial piece of marine tech that could reshape the United States’ defense program.</p> <p>It is the greatest advance in American defense technology in decades - an attack submarine capable of incredible underwater speeds. There is only one problem: A key element of the prototype is missing - and the man who developed it is dead.</p> <p>At the same time, ships have started vanishing mid-ocean, and when a few reappear, bodies are found aboard burned to a crisp.</p> <p>Could these mysterious events be connected to an Italian submarine that itself disappeared in 1943?</p> <p>It is up to NUMA director Dirk Pitt and his team, aided by a beautiful NCIS agent and by Pitt’s children, marine engineer Dirk and oceanographer Summer, to go on a desperate international chase to find the truth, from Washington to Mexico, Idaho to Panama. What they discover at the end of it is a much, much greater threat than even they imagined.</p> <p>Filled with breathtaking suspense and extraordinary imagination, <i>Poseidon’s Arrow</i> is further proof that when it comes to adventure writing, nobody beats Clive Cussler.</p>";
