window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner, 2017 APA Audie Awards - Excellence in Production</b> </p> <p>As a child, Chris Hooper dreamed of monsters. But in deep space, he found only darkness and isolation. Then, on planet LV178, he and his fellow miners discovered a storm-scoured, sand-blasted hell - and trimonite, the hardest material known to man. </p> <p>When a shuttle crashes into the mining ship <i>Marion</i>, the miners learn that there was more than trimonite deep in the caverns. There was evil, hibernating and waiting for suitable prey. Hoop and his associates uncover a nest of Xenomorphs, and hell takes on a new meaning. Quickly they discover that their only hope lies with the unlikeliest of saviors.... </p> <p>Ellen Ripley, the last human survivor of the salvage ship <i>Nostromo</i>. </p>";
