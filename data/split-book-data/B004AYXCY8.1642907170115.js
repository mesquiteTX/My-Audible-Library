In 1916, a British warship mysteriously explodes in the middle of the North Sea. In the present day, a cluster of important mosques in Turkey and Egypt are wracked by explosions. What ties these events together?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Dirk Pitt and his team are about to find out, as artifacts discovered in Turkey and Israel connect to the rise of a fundamentalist movement determined to restore the glory of the Ottoman Empire - and to the existence of a mysterious, long-lost “manifest”, which, if discovered, could change the history of the world as we know it.</p>";
