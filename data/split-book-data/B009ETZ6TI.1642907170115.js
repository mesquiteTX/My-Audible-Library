window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Barry Fairweather dies unexpectedly in his early 40s, the little town of Pagford is left in shock. </p> <p>Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty fa√ßade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils.... Pagford is not what it at first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the town's council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity, and unexpected revelations? </p> <p>Blackly comic, thought-provoking, and constantly surprising, <i>The Casual Vacancy</i> is J.K. Rowling's first novel for adults.</p>";
