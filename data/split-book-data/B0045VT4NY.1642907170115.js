window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Lee Child follows the electrifying <i>61 Hours</i> with his latest Reacher thriller—a story that hits the ground running and then accelerates all the way to a colossal showdown. </p> <p>There’s deadly trouble in the corn country of Nebraska... and Jack Reacher walks right into it. First he falls afoul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved case of a missing child, already decades-old, that Reacher can’t let go. </p> <p>The Duncans want Reacher gone - and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. They’re awaiting a secret shipment that’s already late - and they have the kind of customers no one can afford to annoy. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. </p> <p>For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to keep on going, to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. </p> <p>For Reacher, that was also impossible. </p> <p><i>Worth Dying For</i> is the kind of explosive novel only Lee Child could write and only Jack Reacher could survive - a heart-racing, no-pause thriller no suspense fan will want to miss.</p>";
