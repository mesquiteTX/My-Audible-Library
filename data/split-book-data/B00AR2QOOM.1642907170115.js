window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>October 1945: The Germans and Japanese have surrendered. For Cletus Frade and his colleagues in the OSS, it should be time to pack up - but they have far more important things to do. </p> <p>Chief among them is the protection of their assets, especially the human ones. In the closing months of the war, the United States made a secret deal with the head of German intelligence’s Soviet section. In exchange for a treasure trove of intelligence - in particular the identity of the Soviet spies in the U.S. atomic bomb program - his people would be spirited to safety in Argentina. Only a handful of people know about it. If word got out, all hell would break loose, and the U.S. would lose some of its most valuable sources and secrets. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Argentina, a U-boat captain pops up out of the blue and surrenders his submarine and crew. And in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany, a young counterintelligence agent pursues an unusual assignment perhaps a little too vigorously. The consequences of both actions will affect not only Frade and company, but everything they’re working on. </p> <p>Now things are really going to get complicated. </p> <p>Filled with the special flair that Griffin’s fans have come to expect from him, <i>Empire and Honor</i> is another rousing adventure from one of our finest storytellers.</p>";
