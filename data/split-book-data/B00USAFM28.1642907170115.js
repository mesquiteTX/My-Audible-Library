window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this second audiobook of the Shetland Quartet to feature Inspector Jimmy Perez, the launch of an exhibition at The Herring House art gallery is disturbed by a stranger who bursts into tears, then claims not to remember who he is or where he comes from. The next day he's found dead, wearing a clown's mask. Set in mid-summer, the audiobook captures the unsettling nature of a landscape where the sun never quite sets and where people are not as they first seem. </p>";
