window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The extraordinary new novel in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author's acclaimed series about the real Deep South - \"a joy ride into the heart of darkness\" (<i>The Washington Post</i>). </p> <p>She was just 17, a high school dropout named Milly Jones, found walking down the middle of the highway, engulfed in flames. Even in a tough Mississippi county like Tibbehah, it shatters the community, and it is up to Sheriff Quinn Colson, back on the job after a year away, and his deputy, Lillie Virgil, to investigate what happened and why. Before long, however, accusations start to fly, national media and federal authorities descend, and what seemed like a senseless act of violence begins to appear like something even more disturbing - with more victims waiting in the shadows. </p>";
