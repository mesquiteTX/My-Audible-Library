window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Set in Minnesota, <i>Gone to Dust</i> is the debut private-eye murder mystery from Emmy Award-winning <i>Seinfeld</i> writer Matt Goldman. </p> <p>A brutal crime. The ultimate cover-up. How do you solve a murder with no useable evidence? </p> <p>Private detective Nils Shapiro is focused on forgetting his ex-wife and keeping warm during another Minneapolis winter when a former colleague, neighboring Edina Police Detective Anders Ellegaard, calls with the impossible. </p> <p>Suburban divorc√©e Maggie Somerville was found murdered in her bedroom, her body covered with the dust from hundreds of emptied vacuum cleaner bags, all potential DNA evidence obscured by the calculating killer. </p> <p>Digging into Maggie's cell-phone records, Nils finds that the most frequently called number belongs to a mysterious young woman whose true identity could shatter the Somerville family - but could she be guilty of murder? </p> <p>After the FBI demands that Nils drop the case, Nils and Ellegaard are forced to take their investigation underground, where the case grows as murky as the contents of the vacuum cleaner bags. Is this a strange case of domestic violence or something with far-reaching, sinister implications? </p>";
