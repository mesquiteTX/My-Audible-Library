window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"On every level, <i>Cold Storage</i> is pure, unadulterated entertainment.\" (Douglas Preston, <i>The New York Times</i>)&nbsp;</p> <p><b>For listeners of Andy Weir and Noah Hawley comes an astonishing debut by the screenwriter of </b><b><i>Jurassic Park</i></b><b>: a wild and terrifying adventure about three strangers who must work together to contain a highly contagious, deadly organism</b></p> <p>When Pentagon bioterror operative Roberto Diaz was sent to investigate a suspected biochemical attack, he found something far worse: a highly mutative organism capable of extinction-level destruction. He contained it and buried it in cold storage deep beneath a little-used military repository.</p> <p>Now, after decades of festering in a forgotten sub-basement, the specimen has found its way out and is on a lethal feeding frenzy. Only Diaz knows how to stop it.</p> <p>He races across the country to help two unwitting security guards - one an ex-con, the other a single mother. Over one harrowing night, the unlikely trio must figure out how to quarantine this horror again. All they have is luck, fearlessness, and a mordant sense of humor.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will that be enough to save all of humanity?</p>";
