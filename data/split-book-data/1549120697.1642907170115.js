It's picturesque, but there's something darker lurking behind the scenes.</p> <p>Jackson's current job, gathering proof of an unfaithful husband for his suspicious wife, is fairly standard-issue, but a chance encounter with a desperate man on a crumbling cliff leads him into a sinister network - and back across the path of his old friend Reggie.&nbsp;</p> <p>Old secrets and new lies intersect in this breathtaking novel by one of the most dazzling and surprising writers at work today.</p>";
