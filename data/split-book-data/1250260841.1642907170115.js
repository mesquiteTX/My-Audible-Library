window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this audiobook, Steve Berry and Macmillan Audio team up again to bring listeners an expanded, annotated Writer's Cut edition of </b><b><i>The Warsaw Protocol</i></b><b>. This Writer's Cut edition features fascinating behind-the-scenes commentary read by the author. Critically-acclaimed and award-winning narrator Scott Brick returns to his role as Cotton Malone - eponymous hero of Berry's iconic </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling series - as the seven precious relics of the Arma Christi, the weapons of Christ, disappear one by one from sanctuaries across the world. If you'd like to listen to </b><b><i>The Warsaw Protocol</i></b><b> WITHOUT Steve Berry's commentary, just play the program from the beginning. To listen to the Writer's Cut version WITH Steve Berry's commentary, start with Download Part 2 at 11 hours, 49 minutes. </b></p> <p>After former Justice Department agent Cotton Malone witnesses the theft of one of them, he learns from his old boss, Stephanie Nelle, that a private auction is about to be held where incriminating information on the president of Poland will be offered to the highest bidder - blackmail that both the United States and Russia want, but for vastly different reasons.</p> <p>The price of admission to that auction is one of the relics, so Malone is first sent to a castle in Poland to steal the Holy Lance, a 1,000-year-old spear sacred to not only Christians but to the Polish people, and then on to the auction itself. But nothing goes as planned and Malone is thrust into a bloody battle between three nations over information that, if exposed, could change the balance of power in Europe.</p> <p>From the tranquil canals of Bruges, to the elegant rooms of Wawel Castle, to deep beneath the earth into an ancient Polish salt mine, Malone is caught in the middle of a deadly war - the outcome of which turns on a secret known as the Warsaw Protocol.</p> <p>Praise for Scott Brick as Cotton Malone:</p> <p>\"Brick is a masterful narrator, raising the tension in the action scenes while keeping the listener engaged in the slower historical segments.\" (<i>AudioFile Magazine</i> on <i>The Malta Exchange</i>)</p> <p>\"Narrator Scott Brick's smooth voice flows with the twists and turns of Berry's political thriller...Secrets unravel, and tensions rise as Brick shifts vocal focus from the historical secret society to contemporary conspirators who include corrupt politicians and judges.\" (<i>AudioFile Magazine</i> on <i>The Lost Order</i>)</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Minotaur Books</b>&nbsp;</p>";
