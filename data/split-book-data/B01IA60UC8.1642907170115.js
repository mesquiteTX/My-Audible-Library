window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hailed by the best-selling writer William Kent Krueger as \"the year's best thriller debut\", this roller-coaster listen features a Jack Reacher-like drifter protagonist with lethal skills whose mission to rescue his abducted sister pits him against a meth kingpin seeking to control all the trade in the Western United States. </p> <p>Sixteen years. That's how long Clyde Barr has been away from Colorado's thick forests, alpine deserts, and craggy peaks, running from a past filled with haunting memories. But now he's back, having roamed across three continents as a hunter, an adventurer, a soldier of fortune, and, most recently, an unjustly imprisoned convict. And once again his past is reaching out to claim him. </p> <p>By the light of a flickering campfire, Clyde receives a frantic phone call for help from Jen, the youngest of his three older sisters. Then the line goes dead. Clyde doesn't know how much time he has. He doesn't know where Jen is located. He doesn't even know who has her. All he knows is that nothing short of dying will stop him from saving her. </p> <p>Tagging along with Clyde on this strange, desperate, against-all-odds rescue mission is a young woman named Allie, whose motivations for hurtling into harm's way are fascinatingly complex. As the duo races against the clock, it is Allie who gets Clyde to see what he has become and what he can be. </p>";
