window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the number one&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times&nbsp;</i></b><b>best-selling author of&nbsp;</b><b><i>Sleepers</i></b><b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</b><b><i>The Wolf</i></b><b>, hailed as “simply the best” (Steve Berry) and “one of the most intriguing writers around” (</b><b><i>Newsweek</i></b><b>)....</b><br> <br> <b>A top NYPD detective is pulled out of retirement to take down a notorious drug dealer. But will he risk the only family he’s ever had to crack the case?</b></p> <p>As one of the NYPD’s most trusted “tin badges” - retired detectives brought in to solve cases that are beyond the reach of the everyday force - Tank Rizzo has faced off against some of the city’s toughest criminals without breaking a sweat. To tackle a case involving a dangerous kingpin known as Gonzo, Tank turns to his best friend and ex-partner, Pearl; a former mobster living out a seemingly quiet retirement as the owner of Tank’s favorite Italian restaurant; and a team of expert misfits he would trust with his life. But Gonzo will stop at nothing to defend the empire he's built, and won't hesitate to make it personal.&nbsp;</p> <p>Then Tank gets a call telling him that his brother and sister-in-law, estranged from him for many years, have been killed in a horrific car accident. Tank is the only family left for his orphaned teenage nephew, Chris, although he knows his lifestyle is ill-suited to win him father of the year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chris moves in with Tank, and the two circle each other warily. It’s only when Chris reveals an interest in true crime and a genius-level skill with computers that they begin to bond. Chris’s skills may be exactly what Tank’s team needs to take Gonzo down - but getting him involved could put his life at risk.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Advance praise for </b><b><i>Tin Badges</i></b></p> <p>“Carcaterra&nbsp;capably combines his trademark adrenaline-fueled action with the emotion involved in Tank taking on a parental role&nbsp;for a sometimes surly teen.&nbsp;All this needs, after a cliff-hanger close,&nbsp;is a sequel, and, fortunately, one is promised.”&nbsp;(<i>Booklis</i>t)</p> <p>“Another gem from a writer who has earned his spot at the top echelon of suspense&nbsp;masters... Everything here leaps from the page, never stinting on the harsh reality, delivering a spicy, smart, and entertaining adventure.” (Steve Berry, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of the Cotton Malone series)</p>";
