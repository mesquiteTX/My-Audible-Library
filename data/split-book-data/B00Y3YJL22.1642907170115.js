window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Published in the United Kingdom and Canada as <i>Abattoir Blues</i>.</b> </p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is back in this crackling novel of suspense, a moody and sophisticated mystery full of serpentine curves from <i>New York Times</i> best-selling, Edgar Award-winning author Peter Robinson. </p> <p>One of the world's greatest suspense writers returns with this sensational new novel featuring Inspector Alan Banks, hailed by Michael Connelly as \"a man for all seasons\". </p> <p>It's a double mystery: Two young men have vanished, and the investigation leads to two troubling clues in two different locations - a scorched van and a peculiar bloodstain in an abandoned airport hangar. </p> <p>As Banks and his team scramble for answers, the inquiry takes an even darker turn when a truck careens off an icy road in a freak hailstorm. In the wreckage, rescuers find the driver, who was killed on impact, as well as another body - a body that was dead well before the crash. </p> <p>Snow falls. The body count rises. And Banks, perceptive and curious as ever, feels himself being drawn deeper into a web of crime and at its center something - or someone - dark and dangerous lying in wait. </p> <p>Vibrating with tension, ingeniously plotted, and filled with soul and poignancy, <i>In the Dark Places</i> is a remarkable achievement from this masterful talent. </p>";
