Stirred together, it all makes for one explosive cocktail in this </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling thriller that has Spenser feeling the heat....</b></p> <p>Henry Cimoli and Spenser have been friends for years, yet the old boxing trainer has never asked the private eye for a favor. Until now. A developer is trying to buy up Henry's condo on Revere Beach - with a push from local thugs. Soon, Spenser and his apprentice, Zebulon Sixkill, are on the trail of a mysterious woman, a megalomaniacal Las Vegas kingpin, and a shady plan to turn a chunk of land north of Boston into a sprawling casino. As alliances shift and twisted dreams surface, the Boston political machine looks to end Spenser's investigation one way or another - and once and for all.</p> <p><b>Previously published as </b><b><i>Robert B. Parker's Wonderland</i></b></p>";
