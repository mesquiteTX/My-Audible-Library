window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Another thrilling adeventure from the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author. Clive Cussler's tales of the <i>Oregon</i> and its crew -\"the clever, indefatigable Juan Cabrillo and his merry band of tough, tech-savvy fighting men and women\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) - have made fans of hundreds of thousands of readers and listeners. But the <i>Oregon</i>'s sixth adventure is its most remarkable one yet.</p> <p>On December 7, 1941, five brothers exploring a shaft on a small island off the coast of Washington State make an extraordinary discovery, only to be interrupted by news of Pearl Harbor. In the present, Cabrillo, chasing the remnants of a crashed satellite in the Argentine jungle, stumbles upon a shocking revelation of his own. His search to untangle the mystery leads him, first, to that small island and its secret, and then much farther back, to an ancient Chinese expedition - and a curse that seems to have survived for more than 500 years. If Cabrillo's team is successful in its quest, the reward could be incalculable. If not, the only reward is death. </p>";
