In an isolated belt of Western Australia, they are each other’s nearest neighbor, their homes a four-hour drive apart. The third brother lies dead at their feet. Something caused Cam, the middle child who had been in charge of the family homestead, to die alone in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>So the eldest brother returns with his younger sibling to the family property and those left behind. But the fragile balance of the ranch is threatened. Amid the grief, suspicion starts to take hold, and the eldest brother begins to wonder if more than one among them is at risk of crumbling as the weight of isolation bears down on them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Dark, suspenseful, and deeply atmospheric, <i>The Lost Man</i> is the highly anticipated next audiobook from the best-selling and award-winning Jane Harper, author of <i>The Dry</i> and <i>Force of Nature</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for</b><b><i> The Lost Man</i></b><b>:</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>“What an extraordinary novel: part family drama, part indelible ode to the Outback - a thriller as forceful and atmospheric as a brewing storm. Harper works miracles. We’re lucky to witness them.” (A.J. Finn, number-one <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Woman in the Window</i>)</p>";
