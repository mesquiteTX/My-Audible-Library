window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some secrets just can't stay buried, in the brilliant new Lucas Davenport thriller from the number-one New York Times- bestselling author. \"One of the best,\" said Kirkus Reviews of <i>Storm Prey.</i> \"Razor-sharp dialogue, a tautly controlled pace and enough homicides for a miniseries. What more could fans want?\" </p> <p>A house demolition provides an unpleasant surprise for Minneapolis - the bodies of two girls, wrapped in plastic. It looks like they've been there a long time. Lucas Davenport knows exactly how long.In 1985, Davenport was a young cop with a reputation for recklessness, and the girls' disappearance was a big deal. His bosses ultimately declared the case closed, but he never agreed with that. Now that he has a chance to investigate it all over again, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: It wasn't just the bodies that were buried. It was the truth.</p>";
