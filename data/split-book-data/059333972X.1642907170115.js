window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Number one </b><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>best seller</b></p> <p>Jack Reacher is back! The \"utterly addictive\" (<i>The New York Times</i>) series continues as acclaimed <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author Lee Child teams up with his brother, Andrew Child, fellow thriller writer extraordinaire.</p> <p>“One of the many great things about Jack Reacher is that he’s larger than life while remaining relatable and believable. <i>The Sentinel</i> shows that two Childs are even better than one.” (James Patterson)</p> <p>As always, Reacher has no particular place to go and all the time in the world to get there. One morning he ends up in a town near Pleasantville, Tennessee.</p> <p>But there’s nothing pleasant about the place.</p> <p>In broad daylight Reacher spots a hapless soul walking into an ambush. “It was four against one”...so Reacher intervenes, with his own trademark brand of conflict resolution.</p> <p>The man he saves is Rusty Rutherford, an unassuming IT manager, recently fired after a cyberattack locked up the town’s data, records, information...and secrets.&nbsp;</p> <p>Rutherford wants to stay put, look innocent, and clear his name.</p> <p>Reacher is intrigued. There’s more to the story. The bad guys who jumped Rutherford are part of something serious and deadly, involving a conspiracy, a cover-up, and murder - all centered on a mousy little guy in a coffee-stained shirt who has no idea what he’s up against.</p> <p>Rule one: If you don’t know the trouble you’re in, keep Reacher by your side.&nbsp;</p>";
