Jefferson Parker is the poet of American crime fiction, and</b> <b><i>The Room of White Fire</i></b> <b>absolutely proves why.” (C.J. Box)</b></p> <p><b>In this stirring thriller from&nbsp;</b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b>&nbsp;best seller and award winner T. Jefferson Parker,&nbsp;P.I. Roland Ford must hunt down a soldier who is damaged by war, dangerous, and on the run.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Roland Ford - once a cop, then a marine, now a private investigator - is good at finding people. But when he’s asked to locate an Air Force veteran who’s escaped from a mental institution, he realizes he’s been drawn into something deep and dark. What he doesn’t know is why a shroud of secrecy hangs over the disappearance of Clay Hickman - and why he’s getting a different story from everyone involved. In a flash, what began as just a job becomes a life-or-death obsession for Ford, pitting him against immensely powerful and treacherous people and forcing him to contend with chilling questions about truth, justice, and the American way.</p> <p><b>“A fast-paced, beautifully written thriller.” (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>)</b></p>";
