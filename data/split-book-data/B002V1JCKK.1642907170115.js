First it was the army and the military police, then the police in St. Paul, and finally Lucas Davenport brought him into the BCA, promising him, \"We'll only give you the hard stuff.\" <p> He's been doing the hard stuff for three years now, but never anything like <i>this</i>.</p> <p> In the small town of Bluestem, a house way up on a ridge explodes into flames, its owner, a man named Judd, trapped inside. There are a lot of reasons to hate him, Flowers discovers. In fact, he concludes, you'd probably have to dig around to find a person who doesn't despise Judd.</p> <p> And that isn't even why Flowers came to Bluestem. Three weeks before, there'd been another murder, two, in fact, a doctor and his wife, the doctor found propped up in his backyard, both eyes shot out. Flowers knows two things: this wasn't a coincidence, and it had to be personal.</p> <p> But just how personal is something even he doesn't realize, and may not find out until too late. Because the next victim may be himself.</p>";
