The last time Mike Hammer met up with a blonde she ended up dead, and Hammer inherited a war with the Mob. As he digs deeper, he discovers that about 15 years ago the Mafia had been double crossed. Now, people are dying because of it and the girl with the gun is a crucial witness in the case. While Hammer's enemies are searching the city for him, he is ready to go after them. Along the way, he'll find out just how deadly a kiss can get.</p>";
