David Drayton and his son, Billy, are dragged into a living nightmare as unnatural and violent forces concealed by the mist begin to emerge, wreaking havoc in their wake. Now trapped in the local supermarket with a ragtag group of survivors, David unexpectedly faces a growing threat from within, one that promises to challenge the boundaries of sanity itself. In this horrifying mist, hearing is seeing - and believing. And what you're about to hear, you'll never forget. </p> <p>Originally published in his acclaimed collection <i>Skeleton Crew</i>, this riveting, eerie novella proves why Stephen King is a master storyteller in short form. </p>";
